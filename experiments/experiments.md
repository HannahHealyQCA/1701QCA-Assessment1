(Above is an image of Experiment 8- Compass Game which is played by tilting the microbit to find a random compass heading indicated through the speed of a blinking LED)

#### Reflection ####
When replicating this experiment I learnt the functions of the compass and how to code the compass mechanism of the microbit. I learnt these skills through the creation of a game, consequently I enjoyed discovering the endless opportunities to create new games and testing the facets of the microbit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as an orienteering or scavenger tool as using the led to detect a specific compass heading could lead someone to a goal location. This mechanism could also function as a finding tool for lost objects. Similar to 'find your iphone' it coulde be utilised to find a certain object whether in a treasure hunt or just to find an important lost everyday item.

(Above is an image of the mechanisms of the piezo buzzer experiement. However, the true function cannot be capture in an image.)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt the mechanisms of creating sound with the mircobit both with the pre-made default songs and making custom songs. 

This experiment could be used in a real world context through an alarm with a custom sound. 

### Experiment 3- Dimming LED with Potentiometer ###

### Experiment 11- Pedestrian Crossing ###

(Above is an image of the pedestrian crossing experiemnt. This experiment works just like a real pedestrian crossing and is equipped with LEDs and a piezo buzzer to truly emmulate the real life experience.

#### Reflection ####

WIth in this experiment, I learnt how to make a more complex replication through a multi step experiment that interacts with LEDs, buttons, and the buzzer. Learning how to create a more complex interaction further developed my problem solving skills. This is because whilst replicating this project I noticed that one of the LEDs were not operating. To solve this I first checked the code and found no problems. I then checked the connections on the breadboard and eventually discovered that the LED was not placed with the flat side in the correct direction. Consequently, by venturing out and completing a more complicated experiment I did encounter a obstacle but by overcoming this I developed my problem solving skills.

This experiment could be used in a real life context through a board game that indicates when it is each players turn. This relates through the timing capabilities and the indicators of the LED and the piezo buzzer. This project could also be manufactured as a miniature pedestrian crossing for toy cars.

### Experiment 8- Compass Game ###

(Above is an image of Experiment 8- Compass Game which is played by tilting the microbit to find a random compass heading indicated through the speed of a blinking LED)

#### Reflection ####
When replicating this experiment I learnt the functions of the compass and how to code the compass mechanism of the microbit. I learnt these skills through the creation of a game, consequently I enjoyed discovering the endless opportunities to create new games and testing the facets of the microbit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as an orienteering or scavenger tool as using the led to detect a specific compass heading could lead someone to a goal location. This mechanism could also function as a finding tool for lost objects. Similar to 'find your iphone' it coulde be utilised to find a certain object whether in a treasure hunt or just to find an important lost everyday item.


### Experiment 7- Wind Power ###

(Above is an image of the wind power experiment. One of the images shows the experiment in action as the fan has been blown on and the microbit reads a value in accordance.)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (insert something here).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as on a boat or at an airport. It could be used to measure the wind conditions to determine whether they are suitable for travel. By using this to measure weather, it will be able to predict safe conditions for travel thus making it easier to determine safe travel conditions.



### Experiment 6- Piezo Buzzer ###

(Above is an image of the mechanisms of the piezo buzzer experiement. However, the true function cannot be capture in an image.)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt the mechanisms of creating sound with the mircobit both with the pre-made default songs and making custom songs. 

This experiment could be used in a real world context through an alarm with a custom sound or a customisable doorbell. 



### Experiment 3- Dimming LED with Potentiometer ###

(This is an image of the dimming LED usinng a potentiometer inventors kit experiement. The light level of the red LED can be adjusted using the dimmer.)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was the functions of the potentiometer and how to apply this electric part in a real world context. I also learnt the 'light state' function during the coding process.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as an actual light dimmer. To expand this experiment it could be altered to change the speed of a fan rather than the brightness of an LED.



### Experiment 4- Using Transistor To Drive Motor ###

(This is an image of the motor in action. Within this experiment the fan gradually speeds up to maximum speed and then begins the cycle again.)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, I learnt how to connect and code the speed of a motor. I specifically learnt how to code a loop and how that functions physically.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a wheel of a homemade robot or car as the motor can be used with many different attachments and thus many diverse functions. Using the fan attachment in this experiment you could obviously make a small portable electric fan. It could also be used to circulate the cold air within a freezer or refridgerator.



### Experiment 11- Pedestrian Crossing ###

(Above is an image of the pedestrian crossing experiemnt. This experiment works just like a real pedestrian crossing and is equipped with LEDs and a piezo buzzer to truly emmulate the real life experience.

#### Reflection ####

WIth in this experiment, I learnt how to make a more complex replication through a multi step experiment that interacts with LEDs, buttons, and the buzzer. Learning how to create a more complex interaction further developed my problem solving skills. This is because whilst replicating this project I noticed that one of the LEDs were not operating. To solve this I first checked the code and found no problems. I then checked the connections on the breadboard and eventually discovered that the LED was not placed with the flat side in the correct direction. Consequently, by venturing out and completing a more complicated experiment I did encounter a obstacle but by overcoming this I developed my problem solving skills.

This experiment could be used in a real life context through a board game that indicates when it is each players turn. This relates through the timing capabilities and the indicators of the LED and the piezo buzzer. This project could also be manufactured as a miniature pedestrian crossing for toy cars or a model train.

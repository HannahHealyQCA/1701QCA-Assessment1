#### Reflection ####
When replicating this experiment I learnt the functions of the compass and how to code the compass mechanism of the microbit. I learnt these skills through the creation of a game, consequently I enjoyed discovering the endless opportunities to create new games and testing the facets of the microbit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as an orienteering or scavenger tool as using the led to detect a specific compass heading could lead someone to a goal location. This mechanism could also function as a finding tool for lost objects. Similar to 'find your iphone' it coulde be utilised to find a certain object whether in a treasure hunt or just to find an important lost everyday item.

(Above is an image of Experiment 8- Compass Game which is played by tilting the microbit to find a random compass heading indicated through the speed of a blinking LED)

#### Reflection ####
When replicating this experiment I learnt the functions of the compass and how to code the compass mechanism of the microbit. I learnt these skills through the creation of a game, consequently I enjoyed discovering the endless opportunities to create new games and testing the facets of the microbit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as an orienteering or scavenger tool as using the led to detect a specific compass heading could lead someone to a goal location. This mechanism could also function as a finding tool for lost objects. Similar to 'find your iphone' it coulde be utilised to find a certain object whether in a treasure hunt or just to find an important lost everyday item.

In this experiment, I learnt the mechanisms of creating sound with the mircobit both with the pre-made default songs and making custom songs. 

This experiment could be used in a real world context through an alarm with a custom sound.

WIth in this experiment, I learnt how to make a more complex replication through a multi step experiment that interacts with LEDs, buttons, and the buzzer. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).
